      <p>
        Last night the Toronto Maple Leafs looked to gain their 32nd win of the
        season against the Metropolitan division leading Pittsburgh Penguins in
        their first game with fans since before the Christmas break. The Leafs
        top line consisting of Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner and Michael Bunting
        have been very productive for the Leafs as of late, but the Leafs
        haven't fared too well against the Penguins in their first 2 matchups of
        the season as the Penguins embarrassed them with a 7-1 win while missing
        their top players and then proceeded to shut them out with a 2-0 win a
        few weeks later. Last night would be the first game the Leafs played
        against a full Penguins lineup as Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin hadn’t
        seen Toronto in either of their first 2 matchups. So, it was safe to say
        that the Leafs would need to get to work quickly if they wanted to add
        another win to their record and they did just that. Auston Matthews
        scored his league leading 33rd goal of the season just 21 seconds into
        the game to help get the Leafs off to a fast start. The rest of the 1st
        period didn’t bring any more goals for either team, but the Leafs didn’t
        wait too long before striking again 5 and a half minutes into the 2nd
        period as Leafs alternate captain, Morgan Rielly, skated end to end to
        get his 6th goal of the season. Leafs all-star goalie, Jack Campbell,
        continued to stop all the Penguins shots for the rest of the 2nd period
        and just before it ended the Leafs made it 3-0 with a shorthanded goal
        from forward David Kampf. Toronto looked to hold onto their lead going
        into the 3rd period, but it got a bit smaller as Pittsburgh scored a few
        minutes into it cutting the Leafs lead down to 3-1. Toronto regained
        their 3 goal lead a few minutes later after Michael Bunting, who leads
        the NHL in rookie goal scoring, made the game 4-1. Things got a bit
        scary right after as Auston Matthews left the ice after hitting his face
        off the crossbar. The Leafs stayed focused and held onto the 3 goal lead
        without the help of the team’s superstar who would end up returning to
        the game for the last few minutes. The Leafs would ultimately get the
        4-1 win and upped their season record to 32-12-3. Campbell was the first
        star of the game as he made 45 saves on 46 shots, which was a relief for
        the team and the fans as he hadn’t been playing his best hockey in
        recent games. Leafs head coach, Sheldon Keefe, said in a post-game
        interview that Campbell. making him a lot more comfortable watching the
        game. After last night’s win Toronto still sits in 3rd place in the
        Atlantic division, just 4 points behind the division leading Florida
        Panthers and 3 behind Tampa Bay. They hope to make the gap smaller as
        they matchup against the St. Louis Blues Saturday night, a team that
        they beat in their previous matchup last month.
