      <p>
        It was a very hot , humid day in August, the 18th day of August to be
        exact, in the year 2019. I’ll never forget the details of my day, I set
        my alarm for 6 am -as I had an 8:15 tee off time. I sprung out of bed
        with excitement as I always do on the mornings of golf, little did I
        know what this day had in store for me. I had a quick shower, dressed in
        my favourite golf attire…royal blue golf shirt with a white horizontal
        stripe down the front, also a dark blue pair of adidas dress shorts,
        white ankle socks. For breakfast I had a simple plain bagel with plain
        cream cheese and a steeped tea, I know what you are saying…yes it turned
        out to be “Breakfast of Champions“ . Off to the course I went. This day
        I was playing at Tyandaga Golf Course in Burlington, it’s a nice course
        with average difficulty, can be challenging on certain holes. Today I
        was golfing with my dad and my brother, my dad is a very good golfer, my
        brother, well let’s just say he tries hard. We play a couple of holes ,
        I parred the 1st , bogeyed the 2nd, my dad as usual birdied both, my
        brother got a 9 and an 8 and lost 4 balls, and tossed a couple of his
        clubs….he keeps us laughing that’s for sure!! Anyway , on to the 3rd
        hole, “The Hole!”It was a 178 yard par 3, had to shoot over a pond , it
        is definitely a scenic hole! My dad went first, he put it on the green,
        maybe 5 feet from the hole, a nice shot. My turn…I look in my bag to see
        which club to select, the wind was in our face , I had to choose from
        either the 7 iron or the 6. I decided, due to the wind I had better
        choose the longer club, the 6 it is , I had my weapon! I put my ball on
        a very short tee, just to get it up the grass ever so slightly. I am
        dead centre between the tee blocks. I stand back behind my ball, then
        look to the end flag on the almost kidney shaped green, the reflection
        of the green in the pond before it is undoubtedly something I will not
        soon forget. I move to the ball and assume my stance, taking a couple
        practice swings, all the while trying to remain focused. One last look
        at my target, I take a deep breath, into my backswing I go, with all my
        power I lunge forward into my swing , I hit the ball perfectly. You can
        tell when you hit the ball just right you can hardly feel it. It rose in
        the air, into the cloudless beautiful blue sky, I thought for a split
        second that I possibly hit it too far but the height of the ball drove
        it into the wind and slowed it down. I watched, just hoping to be
        somewhat close, so I could at least putt for a birdie! The ball came
        down, it landed about 2 feet onto the green , one high bounce, then it
        started to roll towards the hole, I thought, that will be close enough
        to birdie…..then it kept rolling, it was on a downhill slope so it
        picked up a little speed, 20 feet turned into 10 feet, it was losing
        pace but going straight at it, 5 feet away, I thought, no it’s not going
        to make it, 3 feet, 2 feet, it was barely moving, 1 foot away, it rolled
        so slow, you could almost see the writing on the ball, and with maybe I
        spin left in the ball, it dropped out of sight!!!!! I’ve never been so
        happy to lose sight of my ball!!! I dropped my club and started jumping
        in the air with my hands over my head, yelling it went in, it went in!!!
        My brother, not much of a golfer said, is that a good thing?…god love
        that kid!! My dad , he was just as excited as I was , he went to his
        knees with his hands in the air, screaming louder then me, I could hear
        cheering from the other golfers around the hole we were at, they
        congratulated me for my rare conquest. We celebrated for a few minutes
        but then realized we had to move on and finish this hole and 15 more!!
        The rest of my round was average but that’s ok, I have a memory that
        will last a lifetime, best of all, I was able to share it with my dad
        and my brother, when we arrived back home and told of the epic
        occurrence to my mom and sister, they were very excited for me! When my
        mom asked my dad what he thought of the shot, he said We all laughed, my
        dad is funny! To this day and forever , that ball will be displayed on a
        mantle wherever I live!!
