      <p>
        One of the most tragic events of the 1990’s was undoubtable the death of
        Diana, Princess of Wales. As we know, Diana was considered the “People’s
        Princess” due to the amazing humanitarian work she did. She was loved by
        so many in her short 36 years. On August 31, 1997 Princess Diana had
        been fleeing the paparazzi in a car with her then companion Mohamed
        “Dodi” Fayed, Diana’s bodyguard, Trevor Rees-Jones and their driver, the
        manager of security at the Hotel Ritz Paris, Henri Paul. In a tragic
        turn of events the car crashed. In this crash everyone was killed except
        for Diana’s bodyguard. It was concluded that the crash was caused by the
        intoxication and reckless driving of Henri Paul. When the world finished
        mourning their Princesses death theories were quick to arise about how
        this may have been a murder instead of a tragic accident like everyone
        believed. Some of the most popular theories are that Diana had been
        killed by the establishment, the paparazzi had caused the crash, driver
        Henri Paul caused the crash intentionally, there was something wrong
        with the car that Diana was in, Diana’s medical care was intentionally
        sabotaged and many more (Griffin, 2017, para. 7-9). One of the most
        interesting theories however, is that Diana was intentionally killed by
        the Royal Family because she had become pregnant with the child of her
        companion Mohamed “Dodi” Fayed (Griffin, 2017, para. 6). Many believe
        this theory could really be the truth behind the tragic event due to the
        fact that there was a lot of controversy surrounding Prince Charles and
        Princess Dianna’s marriage. This event took place shortly after the
        couple finally divorced. But, was it actually the Royal Family trying to
        keep their image clean or was it actually just an unfortunate tragedy
        that took to many people from their families for seemingly no reason? In
        my opinion, I do not believe that this conspiracy theory is true. The
        reason that I do not believe this is because it lacks enough evidence to
        conclusively convince me that it could be true. Not to mention, many of
        these theories have been conclusively proven false and this one is most
        likely no different. Although I do believe that there were some possible
        motives that the Royal Family and some others may have had to possibly
        murder her, I just do not believe that this event was anything other
        than a tragic accident.
